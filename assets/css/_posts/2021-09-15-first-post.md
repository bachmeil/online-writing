I'm experimenting with customizing a blog on Github Pages, done entirely online, using nothing but the browser version of VS Code.

I want this math to display properly: $y_{t}$ and this too

$$y_{t}$$

Okay, so math works just fine. How about code blocks?

```
print("this is a code block in lowercase");
```
