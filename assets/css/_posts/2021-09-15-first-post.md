I'm experimenting with customizing a blog on Github Pages, done entirely online, using nothing but the browser version of VS Code.

I want this math to display properly: $y_{t}$ and this too

$$y_{t}$$

Okay, so math works just fine. How about code blocks?

```
print("this is a code block in lowercase");
```

Now I need better fonts. I sort of have better fonts now. Roboto will work on Linux, but it's often not installed. I added Ubuntu too. That should take care of most Linux users.

Now all I need is something worth writing about.
