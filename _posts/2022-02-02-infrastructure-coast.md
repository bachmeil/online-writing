title: Interesting Paper, Feb 2 Edition
---

Today's paper: [In Harmâ€™s Way? Infrastructure Investments and the Persistence of Coastal Cities](https://economics.mit.edu/files/22033) by Clare Balboni. This is not at all my research area, but I found the idea really interesting.

There are advantages to building a city on the coast, one of which is that there are lower costs when trading with other countries. One reason is that there will be a lower cost of shipping goods abroad after building them. The climate is changing, and that is causing problems for coastal cities. The building of cities along the coast did not account for climate change. She looks at Vietnam, since the issue is especially important there.

This is a rather poor description of the paper. I strongly encourage you to read it if this is the kind of thing that interests you.
