title: "GTD with many notes"
---

> After picking up the book a couple weeks ago, I took its advice and started writing all my thoughts down. But in around two weeks, I wrote about 16000 characters' worth of notes. It's taking ages to sort through them all, does anyone have any advice?

I'm not sure GTD tells you to write all of your thoughts down. You need to capture every commitment you have, and everything still needing a decision. That's different from a journal.

You should not be sorting through all of your notes over and over. You should be reviewing your projects and task lists at least once a week. There's no reason to review other types of notes. Even if it's reference material, you only review the next actions.
