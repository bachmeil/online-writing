> Let's say I have a task that I have to complete until a specific date (a deadline, let's say September 10). I can do it before or at the date, but not after. Should I create it as a calendar event with the date September 10 or I should put it as a generic task and put a specific context?

I come up with a plan for the upcoming week each time I do my weekly review. If the task is due in the next week, it gets scheduled and marked as "must complete". If it's not due in the next week, but I'm ready to start working on it, I will schedule it if I have time. The task goes on a projects or task list (depending on which it is) rather than going into my task manager.
