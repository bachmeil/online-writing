title: Looking for good sites
---
The internet has changed over the last decade. These days the emphasis is on scrolling through social media feeds. Fortunately or unfortunately, take your pick, that isn't my thing. The only social media I use is Twitter, and even that has dwindled steadily since the move to 280 characters and the rise of tweetstorms.

I now visit a very small number of websites on a regular basis (you can count them on one hand). So, in the interest of reviving my internet use, which I think is probably a good thing, I started thinking of ideas for sites I *should* be visiting. I made a list. Here are a few:

- James Hamilton's blog. We work on similar research topics, so this one's obvious.
- Paul Romer's blog. He doesn't post that often, but when he does, it's worth spending time reading and reflecting on it.
- Scott Aaronson's blog. This stuff's outside my expertise. It is a good way to expand my thinking.
- Carl Pullein's blog. The vast majority of productivity writing is garbage. I find Carl's writing to be worth reading from time to time. He doesn't go into a ton of philosophy. His posts are quick to read.
- wibw.com. This is my local news source. Not much of the rage you find on cable "news".
- weather.gov.

The list is a work in progress, and it has a *lot* more than here. I think this was a useful exercise.
