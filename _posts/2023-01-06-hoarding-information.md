title: Hoarding Information
---
There's a link to [this post](https://andreisurugiu.com/blog/bad-habit/) on Hacker News. The author is curious why he collects so many links that he'll never read.

I don't personally see a problem. Sometimes you're not sure if you'll be in the mood to read a link in the future. You can always not read a link you've collected, but you can't read a link that has disappeared.

But that got me to thinking. Why doesn't the browser handle this for you? Click a button and the browser saves a copy. When you're bored, you go through all your saved links. Sure, there are services that do this, but it would be so much easier if it was built into the browser, along with a way to add metadata like tags. You could query all links, in chronological order, that have a particular tag on them.

I don't think hoarding is a problem. You can build up a personal database of stuff that you'll use when the time is right. It *is* a problem if you're leaving browser tabs open in the hope that *someday* you'll read the item. That's not how it works.
