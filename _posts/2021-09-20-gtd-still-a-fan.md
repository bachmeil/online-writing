title: "GTD: I'm still a fan"
---

I've been applying the GTD methodology with various degrees of success for more than a decade. The main reason I've stuck with it is because it's the only thing I've found that works. All the alternatives have failed me. A secondary reason is because it reduces my workload to use GTD. If I'm really busy, I fall back on GTD so I have enough time to do my stuff.
